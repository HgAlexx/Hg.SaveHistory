## About

This tool is the second iteration of the same idea. It is based on Hg.DoomHistory which had most of the same features but was only working with Doom 2016.

Now the tool support a script system, using lua, which allow to add support for any game and any application!


I got the idea while watching [IAmAllstin](https://www.twitch.tv/iamallstin) streaming doom. He was spending a lot of time copy/pasting save files to be able to pratice part of the game for his Ultra-Nightmare run.

Since I was also planning to do Doom on Ultra-Nightmare, I was going to need a way to back my save files too.

The first beta tester was [RedW4rr10r](https://www.twitch.tv/redw4rr10r) who found the first bug and made good improvements suggestions.

[x_ByteMe_x](https://www.twitch.tv/x_byteme_x) who also made good improvements suggestions (global hot keys).
